**Extensions**

At Ultimate Member we are committed to running an open company and letting users know about our future plans for the plugin. So to avoid any potential surprises in the future we wanted to let you know that whilst Ultimate Member core is completely free, we will be releasing paid extensions in the near future. We have decided to do this for a couple of reasons.

First, it allows us to create a powerful and lightweight core plugin that does not include feature bloat. Secondly, having paid extensions means we can work full time on the plugin which allows for faster development and enable us to create the best community/membership plugin ever. Currently there are no extensions available but we're working on hard on creating the first extensions for the plugin. If you'd like to find out when the first extensions will be ready you can follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/umplugin) or like us on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ultimate-Member/1413909622233054).

**Roadmap**

We have big plans. Follow us on the [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/30quaczv/ultimate-member) to see planned features and what to expect from Ultimate Member.

Yes. Ultimate Member will work with any properly coded theme. However, some themes may cause conflicts with the plugin. If you find a styling issue with your theme please create a post in the community forum.

= Does the plugin work with caching plugins? =

The plugin works with popular caching plugins by automatically excluding Ultimate Member pages from being cached. This ensures other visitors to a page will not see the private information of another user. However, if you add features of Ultimate Member to other pages you have to exclude those pages from being cached through your cache plugin settings panel. 

= Does the plugin work on WordPress Multisite? =

We are currently in beta phase so at the moment the plugin only works on single site installs. However, we will be working on ensuring multisite compatibility during the beta period.
